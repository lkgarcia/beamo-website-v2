### Feature Request: Enhance "Contact Us" Form JavaScript to Trigger Mailto

#### Description
Update the existing "Contact Us" form in the repository to use JavaScript for handling form input and dynamically generating a `mailto` operation. This enhancement will allow the form's data (name, email, and message) to populate an email draft, preserving the static nature of the site while introducing interactive functionality.

#### Details
1. **Current Implementation**:
   - The contact section is implemented with a basic form structure in `src/index.html`.
   - There might be placeholder content that needs to be overridden dynamically.

2. **New Requirement**:
   - Use JavaScript to handle form submission.
   - Dynamically generate a `mailto` URL containing the user's input (e.g., `?subject` and `?body` fields).
   - Ensure proper encoding of the user's input.

3. **Acceptance Criteria**:
   - A user fills out the "Contact Us" form (name, email, message) and clicks a "Submit" button.
   - An email draft opens in their default email client, pre-populated with the name, email, and message.
