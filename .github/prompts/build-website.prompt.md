# Beamo Landing Page

A modern, minimal full landing page for Beamo using the brand color palette (Primary: #00B8A8, Secondary: #B4EB45, Accents: #F9F871, #6DD794, #FFCC96).

## Sections

1. **Navigation Bar** — Sticky top nav with Beamo  submark logo, links to page sections, and a "Get Started" CTA button.

2. **Hero Section** — Large headline "Grow Your Business with Beamo", a brief subtitle "Flexible workspaces and digital solutions designed for your growing business. Scale your operations with professional facilities and cutting-edge technology.", a prominent CTA button, and a clean abstract illustration or gradient background using the brand colors.

3. **Services Overview** — The most prominent section of the page. Each service gets its own full-width block with generous vertical space, allowing room for detailed content.

   - **Flexible Workspace** — A large, visually rich section with:
     - Hero-style heading and brief intro paragraph
     - Feature list highlighting key offerings (e.g., private offices, hot desks, high-speed internet, 24/7 access, on-site amenities)
     - Each feature presented with an icon and short description
     - Supporting imagery or illustration alongside the feature grid
     - A CTA button to learn more or book a tour

   - **Digital Solutions** — An equally expansive section with:
     - Hero-style heading and brief intro paragraph
     - Services list detailing offerings (e.g., web development, mobile apps, business automation, cloud solutions, UI/UX design, digital marketing, data analytics, Digital consulting, IT consulting)
     - Each service presented with an icon and short description
     - Supporting imagery or illustration alongside the services grid
     - A CTA button to request a consultation

   Use accent colors for subtle highlights on icons and feature cards. Alternate layout direction (text-left/image-right, then image-left/text-right) between the two service blocks for visual variety.

4. **About Us** — Brief section about Beamo's mission and what sets you apart, with a clean layout and light background.

5. **Our Customers** — A horizontally scrolling showcase of client logos with a continuous rotating animated loop from right to left. Logos should be evenly spaced, displayed at consistent sizes, and maintain the minimal aesthetic of the page.

6. **Testimonials** — A carousel or grid of 2-3 placeholder client testimonials with names and roles.

7. **FAQ** — Accordion-style frequently asked questions section (4-5 placeholder questions).

8. **Contact / CTA Footer** — A final call-to-action with a contact form (name, email, message) and social links, followed by a minimal footer with copyright.

## Design Details
- Clean, modern typography with generous whitespace
- Smooth scroll navigation between sections
- Subtle hover animations on cards and buttons
- Fully responsive (mobile-friendly)
- Brand colors applied as accents throughout, with a predominantly white/light background for the minimal aesthetic
- Text color: #4d4d4d for main body text

### Mesh Gradients
- **Hero Section Background** — Soft, organic mesh gradient using brand colors (#00B8A8, #B4EB45, #F9F871, #6DD794) with high blur radius for a dreamy, modern aesthetic. The gradient should be subtle and not overpower text readability.
- **Section Dividers** — Use subtle mesh gradient overlays between major sections (About Us, Testimonials) with soft transitions between teal (#00B8A8) and lime green (#B4EB45) tones.
- **Service Cards** — Each service card background can feature a very light mesh gradient in its respective accent colors, maintaining high contrast with white/light base.
- **CTA Buttons** — Apply gentle mesh gradient effects on hover states for primary CTA buttons, transitioning through brand colors.
- **Gradient Style** — All mesh gradients should be organic, multi-point gradients with smooth color transitions, avoiding harsh edges or overly saturated areas. Maintain accessibility and text readability as top priority.
